# wace-vault/resources
A compilation of all Google Drive & other resources uploaded to the server, sorted by subject > year > section.
Where appropriate, folders are marked by what they lack (eg. NO SOLS).

## FAQ
### How do I download everything for a subject?
Head on over to the [Releases](https://github.com/wace-vault/collection/releases/latest) section to get a ZIP file containing all resources for whatever subject you need.
Alternatively if you want just a specific folder you can use [this link](https://download-directory.github.io/).

### I have something to contribute
Feel free to contribute! If you're unsure how, check out [the contributing guide](https://github.com/wace-vault/collection/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Where did these resources come from?
Everything in this repository was sourced from the Discord server, either from files directly uploaded by server members, or files in Google Drives shared to the server. Every commit here is titled with a description of where the resources came from if you'd like to find the source of something.
This repository is merely a collection of everything that has been uploaded to the server, in a central location.

### Why are there no past WACE papers?
SCSA took down a past WACE paper archive, so we've tried to upload no past WACE papers to this archive. However, [Ollie's archive](https://olliecheng.me/papers) is still available. Additionally you can use the official [SCSA past exam list](https://senior-secondary.scsa.wa.edu.au/further-resources/past-atar-course-exams), but this won't have as many exams as Ollie's archive.

### Explanation of the notes section
The notes section contains mostly anything miscellaneous from notes to PowerPoints. However if you're looking for y11 notes, it might be best to look in the y12 folder as well, since everything which I was uncertain of which year it pertains to I put in the y12 folder.

### Why doesn't my subject have many resources?
Not all subjects are as popular as each other, nor are there as many resources available. Collecting papers is a neverending process, we're never going to be able to sufficient resources for everyone, but unfortunately that's just the nature of things.

### How long did this take you to compile?
It wasn't timed, but so far it's probably taken 80 hours or so.

### How can I contact you? / How can I join the server?
For any inquiries, use [the discussions](https://github.com/wace-vault/collection/discussions) or [email](mailto:wacedungeon@gmail.com) (irregularly checked).
The server is private, so the invite can't be posted publicly unfortunately.
